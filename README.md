# EasyMoney

Web-based financial management app that tracks monthly spending. The user can set up a monthly budget and savings plan. The user can see a list of all their transactions as well as statistics about their spending such as remaining budget for the month, total spent, and highest spending categories.

## Notes
1. Followed a [Python Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI&ab_channel=TechWithTim) to build the base web-page and then adapted it for our design.
